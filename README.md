Grunt.js build system for Sublime Text 2
========================================

This package enables you to run Grunt.js builds from the excellent Sublime Text 2 editor, with bonus support for build on "Save".

Modification of Jon Schlinkert's original distribution <b>to address OSX compatibility issues</b> - keep grunting!<br />

Quick install
========================================
Download the source and place the folder in your Sublime installation's "Packages" directory Users/[USER]/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages or there's a convenient shortcut in the Sublime file menu "Preferences > Browse Packages...". Restart Sublime and in "Tools > Build System" select your newly installed grunt build package. Cmd+B will commence build and Sublime's console will trace grunt's build script just like Terminal.
